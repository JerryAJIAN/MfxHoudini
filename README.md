Houdini-Engine Open Mesh Effect
===============================

This is an [Open Mesh Effect](https://github.com/eliemichel/OpenMeshEffect) plugin based on the Houdini Engine. It can convert any OBJ or SOP based Houdini Digital Asset library (.hda or .otls file) into an Open Mesh Effect plugin. This plugin may be used for instance as a Blender modifier thanks to the [OpenMeshEffectForBlender](https://github.com/eliemichel/OpenMeshEffectForBlender) branch.

This effect requires that you have a valid Houdini Engine Licence and that the houdini engine is present in the `PATH` environment variable.
